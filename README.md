## Progress
 
*Week 1 schedule*  

Plan for the first week:  
* project skeleton / github project 
* studying the android sensor data
* research similiar apps for trying to get more data on how to implement trick recognization.
* rough ideas of layout/navigation of the app

*Week 1 results*  

* much sensor data
* logic for flipping the phone
* logic for phone rotation
* test fragment done
* trying to make sense of sensor data

*Week 2 schedule*  

For our second week we planned:  
* onboarding screen
* combining the different flip/rotation recognizations
* detecting when phone was stable and in air
* UI construction and testing
* choosing stance
* point system

*Week 2 results*  

* detect plane -> start position for tricks
* goofy and regular stance
* graphics of the application
* localization of strings.xml
* point system and leaderboards
* UX/UI revision
* Documentation
